## Technical Architecture
- **Backend Framework:** Django 3.2+, Django REST Framework 3.12+
- **Authentication Mechanism:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Database Management:** MySQL 8.0+
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Database Design
Prior to system development, a comprehensive database design phase was conducted:
- **Conceptual Modeling:** Entity-Relationship diagrams were created to visualize the data structure.
- **Logical Design:** Flowcharts were used to map out the relationships between different entities.
- **Physical Implementation:** SQL scripts were prepared for database creation and initial setup.

This thorough planning ensured a robust foundation for the system's data architecture.

## Deployment and Configuration
### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Virtual Environment Manager (venv recommended)

### Installation Process
1. **Repository Initialization:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-organization/hotel-management-system.git
    cd hotel-management-system
    ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix-based systems
    # or
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Dependency Installation:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Database Configuration:**
    Update the DATABASES configuration in `settings.py`:
    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            'NAME': 'hms_production',
            'USER': 'hms_admin',
            'PASSWORD': 'secure_password_here',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '3306',
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Database Initialization:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Administrative User Creation:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Development Server Initialization:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
