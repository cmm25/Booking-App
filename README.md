- **Authentication Mechanism:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Database Management:** MySQL 8.0+
- **Development Environment:** Replit
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Database Design

Prior to system development, a comprehensive database design phase was conducted:

1. **Conceptual Modeling:** Entity-Relationship diagrams were created to visualize the data structure.
2. **Logical Design:** Flowcharts were used to map out the relationships between different entities.
3. **Physical Implementation:** SQL scripts were prepared for database creation and initial setup.

This thorough planning ensured a robust foundation for the system's data architecture.

## Deployment and Configuration

### System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Virtual Environment Manager (venv recommended)

### Installation Process

1. **Repository Initialization:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/hotel-management-system.git
   cd hotel-management-system
   ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix-based systems
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Dependency Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Database Configuration:**
   Update the `DATABASES` configuration in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'hms_production',
           'USER': 'hms_admin',
           'PASSWORD': 'secure_password_here',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '3306',
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Database Initialization:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Administrative User Creation:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Development Server Initialization:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
